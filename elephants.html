                <h3> ELEPHANTS</h3>
                   <ul>
                    <p><strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong></p>
                    <li>Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, with some males weighing up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms) and standing over 10 feet (3 meters) tall at the shoulder.</li>
                    <li>They have a long lifespan, often living up to 70 years or more in the wild.</li>
                    <li>Elephants are social animals that live in complex family groups led by a matriarch, typically the oldest and most experienced female. These groups are known for their strong bonds and cooperation.</li>
                   <li>Elephants are renowned for their excellent memory. They can remember locations of water sources, recognize individuals, and even remember past experiences, which helps them adapt to changing environments.</li>
                   <li>Elephants are herbivores, primarily feeding on a diet of grasses, leaves, bark, and fruits. An adult elephant can consume hundreds of pounds of food each day.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
