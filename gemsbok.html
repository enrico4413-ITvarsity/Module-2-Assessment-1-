                <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                   <ul>
                   <p><strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong></p>
                   <li>Gemsboks are known for their striking appearance. They have long, straight horns that can reach lengths of up to 4 feet (1.2 meters). These horns are sharp and pointed, which they use for defense.</li>
                   <li>Gemsboks can be solitary or live in small groups, depending on the availability of food and water. They are also known to form larger herds during migrations.</li>
                   <li>These antelope are well adapted to harsh desert and arid environments. They can obtain most of their water needs from the plants they consume, allowing them to survive in regions with limited water sources</li>
                   <li>Gemsboks are renowned for their incredible endurance and can withstand extremely high temperatures. They have a specialized nasal passage system that helps cool down the blood flowing to their brain.</li>
                   <li>They are primarily herbivorous, feeding on a diet of tough desert grasses, leaves, and shrubs. Their digestive system is adapted to extract maximum nutrients from these fibrous plants.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><strong>WHERE YOU WILL FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <p>You will find the Gemsboks at pen N18, North of the Zoo, next to the Panda zoo.</p>
