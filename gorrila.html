                <h3>Gorilla</h3>
                   <ul>
                   <p><strong>DID YOU KNOW?</strong></p>
                   <li> Gorillas are among the largest and most powerful primates. Adult males, known as silverbacks, can weigh between 300 and 500 pounds (136 to 227 kilograms) and stand up to 6 feet (1.8 meters) tall when upright.</li>
                   <li> Gorillas live in stable family groups led by a dominant silverback male. These groups, called troops, also consist of adult females and their offspring. Silverbacks protect their groups and play a crucial role in maintaining social order.</li>
                   <li> Gorillas are herbivores, primarily feeding on plants, leaves, stems, fruits, and bamboo shoots. They have specialized dentition and digestive systems adapted to a vegetarian diet.</li>
                   <li> All gorilla species and subspecies are listed as endangered or critically endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Conservation efforts, including the protection of their natural habitats and anti-poaching initiatives, are essential for their survival.</li>
                   <li>  Gorillas communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, body language, and facial expressions. They can display signs of affection, such as hugging and grooming, and use vocalizations to signal their intentions or emotions.</li>
                   </ul>
                   <p><strong>WHERE YOU WILL FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                   <p>You will find the gorillas at pen W5, next to the monkeys, on the west side of the zoo.</p>
